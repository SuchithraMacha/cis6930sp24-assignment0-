###NOTE
IN THE TEST_DOWNLOAD_PDF METHOD, WE MOCK REQUESTS.GET AND OPEN TO AVOID ACTUAL NETWORK REQUESTS 
AND FILE OPERATIONS. THEN, WE ASSERT THAT THE FUNCTIONS ARE CALLED CORRECTLY.

IN THE OTHER TEST METHODS, WE MOCK SQLITE3.CONNECT AND CURSOR TO AVOID ACTUAL DATABASE OPERATIONS. 
WE ALSO MOCK SYS.STDOUT TO CAPTURE THE OUTPUT OF THE STATUS FUNCTION.
